    To extract all unique words from the provided subtitle text and present them in the order they first appear (unsorted, maintaining their sequence in the text), I will process the subtitle and translation columns, treating both as a single text source since they are identical. The words will be extracted by splitting the text into individual words, removing duplicates while preserving the first occurrence order, and ignoring punctuation, special characters, numbers (e.g., "305"), and sound effects (e.g., "[sighs]"). The list will be case-insensitive to avoid duplicating words like "I'm" and "i'm". Names like "Professor Mosby" are treated as single words when they function as proper nouns, but individual components (e.g., "Robin") are considered separate words if used independently. Contractions (e.g., "I'm", "don't") and hyphenated terms (e.g., "all-time") are treated as single words if they function as a unit. Only the first occurrence of each unique word is included.
