    To extract all unique words from the provided subtitle text and present them in the order they first appear (unsorted, maintaining their sequence in the text), I will process the subtitle and translation columns, treating both as a single text source since they are identical. The words will be extracted by splitting the text into individual words, removing duplicates while preserving the first occurrence order, and ignoring punctuation, special characters, numbers (e.g., "2:00", "12"), and sound effects (e.g., "[laughing]"). The list will be case-insensitive to avoid duplicating words like "I'm" and "i'm". Names like "Holli" and "Holly" will be treated as distinct words unless context indicates they are the same (e.g., "Holli" is spelled with an "I" in the text). Contractions (e.g., "I'm", "don't") are treated as single words, and hyphenated terms (e.g., "three-days") are considered one word if they function as a single unit. Only the first occurrence of each unique word is included.
